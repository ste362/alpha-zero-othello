## 🧠 About the Project

This project applies **AlphaZero** to the game of **Othello (Reversi)** ⚫⚪  
It combines cutting-edge techniques in **reinforcement learning**  and **deep learning**  to create a self-learning game-playing agent 

### Topics Covered in the Report:
- 🚀 **AlphaZero Algorithm** – Self-play, learning from scratch, and no human input needed 🎯🧠  
- 🧩 **Neural Network Architecture** – CNNs and dense layers to predict moves and game outcomes 🖥️🔮  
- 🌲 **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** – How the agent searches and improves over time 🌳🕵️‍♀️  
- 🔬 **Training & Experiments** – 6×6 and 8×8 board configurations, performance stats, and comparisons 📈🧪  
- 🧠 **Conclusions & Learnings** – Key takeaways and ideas for improvements ✨📘

## Improvements
The improvements in the code result in a 10x speedup in training time. As a result, the model can also be trained on lower-end hardware; I used a GTX 1050 Ti to obtain the reults showed in the report.
Additional improvements come from a different training strategy, which accelerated the policy learning process compared to traditional methods.
